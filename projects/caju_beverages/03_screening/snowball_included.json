      "description": "Abstract Cashew ( Anacardium occidentale ) has received both local and international recognition due to its expanding production capacity, trading, and nut utilization. The cashew apple, which forms about 90% of the total fruit weight, is left on the farmers' fields as agricultural waste owing to limited knowledge of its health benefits, a lack of technical know‐how and processing equipment, and its high perishability and astringent taste. Numerous studies have been conducted exploring the nutrients and contribution of the apple to human nutrition. This paper reviewed recent articles on the nutritional composition and health benefits of cashew apples for easy accessibility and readership. Cashew apple contains good amounts of vitamin C, sugars (fructose and sucrose), fibers, flavonoids, carotenoids, total polyphenols, volatile components, flavanols, amino acids, and minerals, such as potassium, magnesium, sodium, and iron, which are good for maintaining strong immunity, scavenging free radicals, neuropathic functioning, cardiac functioning, and maintenance of body and skin integrity. Cashew apple is associated with weight loss, and is good for diabetic patients due to its high content of flavonoids (myricetin and quercetin). Consumption of cashew apple and its value‐added products confer good health, therapeutic effects in the management of diabetics and cardiovascular diseases, and also ensure food and nutrition security. It is hoped that this review will contribute significantly to the expanding body of knowledge aimed at promoting cashew apple utilization globally.",

      "description": "In addition to the cashew nut, which is the main product, the cashew tree also produces the cashew apple which is considered a by-product. The cashew apple has a high nutritional potential. Indeed, it is rich in vitamin C, carotenoids, dietary fibers, vitamins, sugars and mineral elements where are essential for human nutrition. In addition to its nutritional quality, the cashew apple has technological advantages: the edible part of the fruit is between 85% and 100% higher than that of other traditional tropical fruits, and its juicy and sweet flesh is free of seeds or pits. In addition, very large volumes are available. As a result, the development of this fruit represents a considerable economic challenge. This paper first presents the cultivation of cashew trees and the bibliography of the work done on cashew juice. The favorable conditions for cashew tree cultivation and the planting method were presented. Then, the study highlights the work done on the physicochemical characteristics of cashew apples, the effect of the growing area, the variety and the stage of maturity on its characteristics. It also shows the influence of the processing steps on the nutritional value and organoleptic quality of the cashew apple; as well as the methods of clarification, stabilization, concentration and dehydration. Some uses of cashew apple were reviewed: beverage, food, substrate, bioethanol, nutraceutical, food additive and agro materials.",

Comparative esterification methods indicated that cashew apple juice contained significant amounts of free lauric acid. Oleic and linoleic acids occur in almost identical, amounts in cashew nut testa whereas oleic acid predominates in the kernel.

The application of bioethanol in the motor-fuel industry can contribute to reduction in the use of fossil fuels and in turn to decreased carbon emissions and stress of the rapid decline in crude oil availability. Bioethanol production methods are numerous and vary with the types of feedstock used. Feedstocks can be cereal grains (first generation feedstock), lignocellulose (second generation feedstock), or algae (third generation feedstock) feedstocks. To date, USA and Brazil are the leading contributors to global bioethanol production. In sub-Saharan Africa, bioethanol production is stagnant. During the 1980s, bioethanol production has been successful in several countries including Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Kenya. However, because of numerous challenges such as food security, land availability, and government policies, achieving sustainability was a major hurdle. This paper examines the history and challenges of bioethanol production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and demonstrates the bioethanol production potential in SSA with a focus on using bitter sorghum and cashew apple juice as unconventional feedstocks for bioethanol production.",

Thus, the formulation of mixed juice based on cashew apple juice and passion fruit juice has proved to be a way of adding value to the cashew apple, a co-product of the production of the nut. After the formulation of the mixed juice in different proportions and the sensory evaluation, it appears that the juice of formulation E is more appreciated by the tasters. Indeed, this juice has preferred sensory characteristics in terms of color (6.90), flavor (5.47), odor (6.42), settling (6.28) and overall acceptance (6.53). These characteristics are similar to those of passion fruit juice in terms of color, odor, and overall acceptance, where the latter obtained scores of 6.94, 7.17 and 6.00 respectively; and also, to those of cashew apple juice in terms of flavor and decanting, where the latter obtained scores of 5.19 and 6.14 respectively. Therefore, the addition of passion fruit juice to cashew apple juice results in a new product that is more appreciated when mixed with proportions of 90 mL of passion fruit juice and 10 mL of cashew apple juice. For example, passion fruit juice, due to its color, flavor, and odor, has helped reduce the pronounced astringency of raw cashew apple juice. Ultimately, formulation E is recommended to improve the organoleptic value of cashew apple juice.",

The lowest pH among all samples was seen in Ew-/Ca-ML50%S3 and Ew-/Co-ML50%S3 during the 21 days of storage. S. thermophilus increased to the highest numbers in Co-/Ca-ML50%S3 during 7th and 14th day as compared to other treated samples. All EwML100% were the most accepted by the panels compared to other samples. In conclusion, the combination of EwM with Co-/Ca-M during labneh preparation might enhance the viability of all different starter cultures especially S3 during the storage.",

      "description": "\\n O pedúnculo de caju é carnoso, suculento, nutritivo, de aroma agradável e perecível. Sua baixa aceitação para o consumo in natura se deve aos taninos, que são os fenólicos causadores da adstringência. Para reduzir essa sensação, deve-se polimerizar os taninos com o acetaldeído, tornando-os insolúveis e incapazes de reagir com as enzimas da boca. O objetivo do trabalho foi estudar métodos de redução da adstringência de pedúnculos de caju e seus efeitos sobre qualidade físico-química, nutricional e aromática. Os experimentos conduzidos testaram dose, tempo e temperatura de exposição dos cajus ao etanol ou dióxido de carbono e o melhor filme plástico para obtenção da atmosfera modificada passiva. O teor de etanol, acetaldeído, proantocianidinas (taninos) e polifenois dos cajus foram influenciados pela dose, mas não pelo de tempo de exposição ao etanol, sendo 3,50 mL kg-1 por 12 h o mais indicado. A destanização não sofreu influência da temperatura, mas quando feita a 25°C, resultou em cajus com maior podridão e menor firmeza. O DPPH foi correlacionado com as proantocianidinas e fenóis, tendo maior perda na destanização a 25°C. O FRAP na fração lipossolúvel foi correlacionado com as quercetinas, sofrendo maior perda na destanização a 5°C. A análise de perfil dos compostos aromáticos identificou 26 ésteres, 12 álcoois, 8 aldeídos, 8 terpenos, 2 ácidos carboxílicos, 2 cetonas, 2 fenóis e 2 hidrocarbonetos. Os dias de armazenamento tiveram maior relevância do que a destanização para a presença e intensidade dos aromas, independentemente da temperatura. Portanto, a aplicação de 3,5 mL etanol por kg de caju, por 12 h e 5°C remove a adstringência e pouco afeta a qualidade nutricional e o perfil dos compostos aromáticos. A aplicação do CO2 induziu a respiração anaeróbica, reduziu as proantocianidinas e adstringência e não fermentou os cajus. O uso de 100% de CO2 por 12 e 24 h e 80% por 48 h reduziram o teor ácido ascórbico, antocianinas, DPPH e FRAP hidrossolúvel nos primeiros dias do armazenamento. Cajus submetidos a 80% de CO2 por 48 h tiveram as maiores perdas de massa. A destanização a 24 e 48 h reduziu a incidência de podridão. A dose de 100% de CO2 por 24 h é a mais indicada por reduzir a adstringência de forma imediata, não prejudicar a qualidade fisico-química e resultar nas menores perdas nutricionais dos pedúnculos de caju. O uso dos filmes poliamida/polietileno (PA/PE) 100 &amp;mu;m e polipropileno de camada biorientada (BOPP) 50 &amp;mu;m reduziu a adstringência, ampliou a vida útil dos cajus em 12 dias e conservou a coloração da epiderme, o teor de antocianinas e quercetinas e a atividade antioxidante. A comparação entre eles mostrou diferença apenas no teor de ácido ascórbico e no DPPH no 24º dia de armazenamento, quando pedúnculos embalados em PA/PE apresentaram os melhores resultados. Entretanto, esses pedúnculos apresentaram odor característico de fermentado desde o dia 3. Dessa forma, o BOPP 50 &amp;mu;m é o filme mais indicado para redução da adstringência e conservação dos pedúnculos de caju.\\n",
