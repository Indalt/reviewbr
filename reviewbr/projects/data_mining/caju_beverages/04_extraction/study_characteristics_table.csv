Physico-chemical (moisture, ash, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, energy value, total acidity, pH, alcohol content, density, and primitive, real, and apparent extracts) and sensory analyses were performed, along with microbiological assessments.","The addition of orange peels and cashew pseudofruit as adjuncts resulted in strong (original extracts ≥ 14%), acidic (0.22 g acetic acid/100ml), alcoholic (5.23%), and fruity beers. The addition of cashew contributed to increased acidity, lower pH (4.12), higher alcoholic content (5.17%), and higher original (23.23%) and apparent (32.13%) extracts. Sensorial analysis showed all formulations had positive acceptance, but the fruit additions did not significantly differentiate the formulations from the control."

The antioxidant capacity of juice and flour was assessed using ABTS and DPPH methods. In vivo tests involved treating mice with different doses of SFM and SFV, followed by assessment of physiological parameters, humoral and cellular immune responses using sheep red blood cells (SRBC).","Cashew green bagasse flour exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity and polyphenol levels. The cashew juice and SFV at 300 mg/kg showed higher antibody titers in the humoral response.

"Autor Desconhecido","2010","[Estudo sobre Anacardium occidentale L.]: INFLUÊNCIA DE CONDIÇÕES OPERACIONAIS","Alcoholic fermentation of cashew juice","The study evaluated the production of ethanol from cashew juice, assessing the influence of temperature on the kinetics of ethanol production. Different microorganisms were evaluated, and the impact of the initial concentration of carbohydrates (glucose and fructose) in the cashew juice was studied, applying mathematical models to describe the kinetics.","The study concluded that cashew juice is a suitable substrate for ethanol production.  The use of cashew juice will not only bring economic benefits to the process, because it is a low-cost substrate, but will also bring environmental benefits, since it is an agro-industrial waste from cashew nut production. The best temperature range for fermentation was between 30 and 38°C."

In vitro, total polyphenol content, ascorbic acid, total anthocyanins, yellow flavonoids, carotenoids, phenolic compounds, and total antioxidant activity were determined. In vivo, the anti-inflammatory effect was assessed using the xylene-induced ear edema model in mice, and wound healing was evaluated by inducing lesions on the backs of mice after supplementation with cashew juices.","The phytochemical profile differed between green and ripe cashew juice, with ripe cashew juice showing higher levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants and total antioxidant capacity. Green cashew juice efficiently reduced inflammation and accelerated wound healing during the intermediate phase compared to ripe cashew juice, while ripe cashew juice seemed to act in the later stages of healing."

In vitro digestion simulation was conducted at 37 °C/6 h, evaluating the concentration of glyco-oligosaccharides, dextran, and tagatose, and vitamin C bioaccessibility. The prebiotic effect was assessed using Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium breve, and Bifidobacterium infantis.","Oligosaccharides, tagatose, and part of dextran (70-90%) resisted gastrointestinal conditions, reaching the final part of the digestive system where probiotic microorganisms consume prebiotic carbohydrates. Prebiotic juices improved vitamin C bioaccessibility, suggesting a protective effect. The prebiotic ingredients stimulated the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, with tagatose benefiting B. infantis, and dextran and oligosaccharides benefiting L. casei and B. breve, respectively."

The bark concentrations were 0 and 0.6 % (m/m) and cashew, 0, 5 and 10 % (m/m), resulting in six different combinations. The raw materials were characterized by physico-chemical assessment and added to the fermentation phase. The formulations were subjected to low fermentation, maturation and carbonation.","The use of cashew peduncle and orange peel in the preparation of craft beers is feasible. The formulation number six, containing 10% cashew pseudofruit (m/m) and 0.6% orange peel (m/m), presented the most satisfactory results.

The experimental design included a pre-clinical study with murine NERD induced surgically and a clinical study with human esophageal biopsies, assessing inflammation, barrier function, and toxicity.","Cashew gum exhibited anti-inflammatory properties by reducing edema and inflammatory cell infiltration in the esophagus. It also showed protective effects by preserving esophageal mucosal integrity, sustaining transepithelial electrical resistance, and preventing increased transepithelial permeability. Furthermore, cashew gum demonstrated strong mucoadhesive properties, forming an extra shield on the pre-epithelial layer."

The study involved investigating the conformation and structure of the compounds to determine the functional groups of the molecule, assessing the toxicological effects of the surfactin produced, and evaluating the maintenance of the tensioactive characteristics of surfactin under different environmental conditions.","Spectra indicated similarity between the surfactin produced and standard surfactin. The lipopeptide exhibited highly stable surface activity, with a CMC of 12.5 mg/L, reducing water surface tension to 31.8 mN/m and n-hexadecane interfacial tension to 2 mN/m. The biosurfactant also demonstrated non-toxicity towards Artemia salina and Lactuca sativa, suggesting its potential in cosmetics, food, and pharmaceutical industries, and it efficiently removed diesel and petroleum from sand."

Ultrasound (372.93 W/cm2; 20 °C; 10 min), ozone (0.24 mgO3/mL), and pulsed light (1 J/cm2) were applied to the cashew juice.","Ultrasound increased the antioxidant capacity of cashew juice, while heat treatment decreased it. Ozone preserved antioxidant activity but decreased flavonoids and vitamin C. Pulsed light increased antioxidant activity and preserved flavonoids and vitamin C concentrations.  These non-thermal technologies can be used alone or combined with other treatments in the processing of cashew juice to better preserve its natural characteristics."

The study compared drying processes using a forced air circulation oven and freeze-drying and applied the pre-treated fiber in a plant-based croquette-type product. Sensory evaluation, physical, and physicochemical analyses were conducted on the fiber and croquettes.","The sensory perception of cashew flavor in the fiber is weak after the second cycle of hydration and pressing, suggesting that the number of cycles can be reduced. Freeze-drying equipment obtained the best drying results.  Croquettes with up to 40% cashew fiber were well-accepted, while those with 50% fiber had a perceptible cashew flavor."

"Ohoud Shami Al-sulbi, Amal Bakr Shori","2022","Viability of selected strains of probiotic Lactobacillus spp. and sensory evaluation of concentrated yogurt (labneh) made from cow, camel, and cashew milk","Not Specified (General Processing)","The study investigated the effects of concentrated yogurt (labneh) made from cow, camel, and cashew milk and their mixtures using three strains of probiotic Lactobacillus spp. as starter cultures on post-acidification changes and the viability of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) during storage. Sensory evaluation of all yogurt samples was also conducted on the first day of storage.","The lowest pH was observed in Ew-/Ca-ML50%S3 and Ew-/Co-ML50%S3 during 21 days of storage. S. thermophilus increased to the highest numbers in Co-/Ca-ML50%S3 during the 7th and 14th day. All cashew milk labneh samples (EwML100%) were the most accepted by the panels."
"Jaqueline Visioni Tezotto-Uliana","2017","Métodos de redução da adstringência de pedúnculos de caju <i>in natura</i> e seus efeitos sobre a qualidade físico-química, nutricional e aromática","Not Specified (General Processing)","The study investigated methods to reduce astringency in cashew apples using ethanol and carbon dioxide treatments, evaluating dosage, time, and temperature. It also tested different plastic films for passive modified atmosphere packaging.","Treatment with 3.5 mL ethanol per kg of cashew apple for 12 hours at 5°C effectively reduced astringency with minimal impact on nutritional quality and aroma. Applying 100% CO2 for 24 hours also reduced astringency without compromising physicochemical qualities. BOPP film (50 μm) was identified as the most suitable for astringency reduction and cashew apple preservation."
