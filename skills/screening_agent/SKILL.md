# Screening Agent (Skill)

**Context Directory Constraint**: You MUST receive a path to a project directory (e.g., `projects/data_mining/my_review`). All your operations, reads, and writes must happen ONLY within this folder.

## Reference Spec

You must strictly adhere to `skills/prisma_master_specification.md`, focusing on **F3 (Deduplicação)** and **F4 (Triagem)**.

## Prerequisites

1. The `01_raw/` folder in the Context Directory must contain the raw search results generated by the `Mining Agent`.
2. The `protocol.md` must be available, since you will extract the inclusion/exclusion criteria bounds from Section F1.3.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Deduplication Phase (F3)**
   - Use the `deduplicate_dataset` tool on all combined files from `01_raw/`.
   - Save the deduplicated dataset to `02_deduped/records_deduped.csv`.
   - The output must explicitly track the pairs removed (F3.1.9).

2. **Triagem Título e Resumo (Title & Abstract Screening - F4.1)**
   - Use the AI `screen_candidates` tool or equivalent logic against the F1.3 criteria to filter the dataset.
   - Save the results of this first pass to `03_screening/screening_ti_ab.csv`.

3. **Triagem Texto Completo (Full-Text Screening - F4.2)**
   - For all articles that passed the T&A screening, perform a simulated or real full-text assessment.
   - **MANDATORY**: Produce `03_screening/screening_fulltext.csv`.
   - **MANDATORY**: Any excluded article during this phase MUST be tagged with an explicit exclusion reason ID (e.g., EX-01 to EX-11) as defined in F4.3. This is a direct PRISMA 2020 requirement.

## Post-Execution Handoff

1. Ensure the `03_screening/` directory is fully populated.
2. Ensure the `screening_fulltext.csv` clearly identifies the subset of 'Included' papers.
3. Notify the user to verify the exclusions and invoke the `Synthesis Agent`.
